this is a simple equation solver using c# language. 

For example, if the C# program is compiled to myEquation.exe, the following demonstartes how it wil appear in the command line:

calc 3X + 5 = 8
X = 1

In the command line, the argument is entered as the the "calc" keyword followed by a sapce and followed by a sequence of of numbers, variables, and operators, such as:
calc <equation formula>
Hitting the enter key will cause the programm to evaluate the arguments and print the reauslt as onre or more numbers separated by ",":

x = `<result>, <result>`.

`calc X + 2 = 6`           <br> `x = 4`<br>
`calc 3X - 6 = 9`          <br> `x = 5`<br>
`calc X = 5*X - 5 * 3`     <br> `x = 3.75`<br>
`calc 5(2) + 5x = 15`      <br> `x = 1`<br>
`calc X / 5 = 6`           <br> `x = 30`<br>
`calc (x-2) = 0`           <br> `x = 2`<br>
`calc 2x + 8 = 4x - 20`    <br> `x = 14`<br>
`calc 4(4x) + 2(x) = 72`   <br> `x = 4`<br>
