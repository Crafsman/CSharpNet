this is a simple equation solver using c# language. 

For example, if the C# program is compiled to myEquation.exe, the following demonstartes how it wil appear in the command line:

calc 3X + 5 = 8
X = 1

In the command line, the argument is entered as the the "calc" keyword followed by a sapce and followed by a sequence of of numbers, variables, and operators, such as:
calc <equation formula>
Hitting the enter key will cause the programm to evaluate the arguments and print the reauslt as onre or more numbers separated by ",":

x = `<result>, <result>`.

calc X + 2 = 6           x = 4
calc 3X - 6 = 9          x = 5
calc X = 5*X - 5 * 3     x = 3.75
calc 5(2) + 5x = 15      x = 1
calc X / 5 = 6           x = 30
calc (x-2) = 0           x = 2
calc 2x + 8 = 4x - 20    x = 14
calc 4(4x) + 2(x) = 72   x = 4
